# advent-of-code
My solutions for each day of the Advent of Code problems.

Advent of Code is an annual event, where a programmer named [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) uploads a programming challenge every day in December until Christmas, much like an advent calendar- hence the name.
Here's a brief excerpt from [the site's about page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about), which explains it in more detail:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

The purpose of this Github repo is to keep track of my work more efficiently, and to document my participation and solutions.
