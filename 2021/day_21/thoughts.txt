Okay, obviously simulating all of those games of Dirac dice is completely insane and would never terminate.
I think the answer is going to just be calculating possible games. That is, given an initial starting position and a target score, how many different games can possibly fit into that score amount? And of those possible games, which win for player 1 and which for player 2?
A complicating factor is the actual calculation of score. A dice roll does not directly correspond to score; the score after each roll is a function of the dice roll and the player's position. Still, as the score total is quite low (21), this hopefully shouldn't make things too messy.
Another thing! It would be easiest to calculate all the distinct permutations that add up to 21 points, and then see which ones contain the starting points of each player.
Or maybe how many games win after x turns for each player? Identical rolls for each player in each 'game' could be used for this. 
The longest a game can possibly last is 6 turns, consisting of each player starting at square 1 and rolling a 1 every turn.
The shortest a game can possibly last is 3 turns, consisting of each player starting at square 7 and rolling a 1 every turn.
Optimisations:
- Check if a game is completed after optimal rolls. If not, move on to the next game length.
- If a player wins with a set of particular dice rolls, they must necessarily also win with that set of rolls for every possible game that their opponent makes worse rolls.
- Caching: all 4-turn games are a 3 turn game with 1 extra move, etc.
- Only need to record how many times a score occurs (with final position) for a certain game length, not the individual rolls
- If a game hasn't gone over 10 within x rolls, it is congruent to all other permutations of games with those rolls
